# Reporting a security issue

Although rare, we take security bugs in Twinkle seriously.

If you believe you have found a security issue, please **privately** contact one or both of the currently-active maintainers:

* @Amorymeltzer: [Email](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:EmailUser/Amorymeltzer)
* @MusikAnimal: [Email](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:EmailUser/MusikAnimal)

Please include "Twinkle Security" in the subject line and include as much information in the body as you are capable of providing.  We will respond as quickly as we are able with further steps.

If one of use doesn't respond in a timely fashion, you can try to [contact another interface-admin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:ActiveUsers?groups=interface-admin&excludegroups=bot) with the same information.
