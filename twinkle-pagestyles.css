/**
 * This is loaded as a hidden peer gadget of Twinkle.
 * Why is this a peer gadget? Because it will load before the page finishes its first paint.
 * It adds whitespace where the "TW" menu goes in the Vector 2010 skin, basically reserving
 * a spot for the "TW" menu so that the top bar does not "jump".
 * The "TW" menu itself is painted later, after the gadget JS files finish loading.
